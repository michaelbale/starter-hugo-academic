            ABSTRACT
            
              Little is known about the emergence and persistence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected T-cell clones in perinatally infected children. We analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for clonal expansion in 11 children who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) between 1.8 and 17.4 months of age and with viremia suppressed for 6 to 9 years. We obtained 8,662 HIV type 1 (HIV-1) integration sites from pre-ART samples and 1,861 sites from on-ART samples. Expanded clones of infected cells were detected pre-ART in 10/11 children. In 8 children, infected cell clones detected pre-ART persisted for 6 to 9 years on ART. A comparison of integration sites in the samples obtained on ART with healthy donor PBMCs infected
              ex vivo
              showed selection for cells with proviruses integrated in
              BACH2
              and
              STAT5B
              . Our analyses indicate that, despite marked differences in T-cell composition and dynamics between children and adults, HIV-infected cell clones are established early in children, persist for up to 9 years on ART, and can be driven by proviral integration in proto-oncogenes.
            
            
              IMPORTANCE
              HIV-1 integrates its genome into the DNA of host cells. Consequently, HIV-1 genomes are copied with the host cell DNA during cellular division. Pediatric immune systems differ significantly from adults, consisting primarily of naive T cells, which have low expression of the HIV-1 coreceptor CCR5. This difference may result in variances in the number or size of infected cell clones that persist in children on ART. Here, we provide the most extensive analysis of the integration landscape of HIV-1 in children. We found that, despite the largely naive cell populations in neonatal immune systems, patterns of HIV-1 integration and the size of infected cell clones are as large and widespread as those in adults. Furthermore, selection for integration events in proto-oncogenes were observed in children despite early ART. If such cell clones persist for the life span of these individuals, there may be long-term consequences that have yet to be realized.},

	abstract = {The latent HIV-1 reservoir is comprised of stably integrated and intact proviruses with limited to no viral transcription. It has been proposed that latent infection may be maintained by methylation of pro-viral DNA. Here, for the first time, we investigate the cytosine methylation of a replication competent provirus (AMBI-1) found in a T cell clone in a donor on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methylation profiles of the AMBI-1 provirus were compared to other proviruses in the same donor and in samples from three other individuals on ART, including proviruses isolated from lymph node mononuclear cells (LNMCs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We also evaluated the apparent methylation of cytosines outside of CpG (i.e., CpH) motifs. We found no evidence for methylation in AMBI-1 or any other provirus tested within the 5′ LTR promoter. In contrast, CpG methylation was observed in the env-tat-rev overlapping reading frame. In addition, we found evidence for differential provirus methylation in cells isolated from LNMCs vs. PBMCs in some individuals, possibly from the expansion of infected cell clones. Finally, we determined that apparent low-level methylation of CpH cytosines is consistent with occasional bisulfite reaction failures. In conclusion, our data do not support the proposition that latent HIV infection is associated with methylation of the HIV 5′ LTR promoter.},

The distribution of IS in vivo is quite similar to the distribution in PBMC, but modified by selection against proviruses in expressed genes, by selection for proviruses integrated into one of 7 specific genes, and by clonal expansion. Clones in which a provirus integrated in an oncogene contributed to cell survival comprised only a small fraction of the clones persisting in on ART.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: All retroviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), must integrate a DNA copy of their genomes into the genome of the infected host cell to replicate. Although integrated retroviral DNA, known as a provirus, can be found at many sites in the host genome, integration is not random. The adaption of linker-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) protocols for high-throughput integration site mapping, using randomly-sheared genomic DNA and Illumina paired-end sequencing, has dramatically increased the number of mapped integration sites. Analysis of samples from human donors has shown that there is clonal expansion of HIV infected cells and that clonal expansion makes an important contribution to HIV persistence. However, analysis of HIV integration sites in samples taken from patients requires extensive PCR amplification and high-throughput sequencing, which makes the methodology prone to certain specific artifacts.
RESULTS: To address the problems with artifacts, we use a comprehensive approach involving experimental procedures linked to a bioinformatics analysis pipeline. Using this combined approach, we are able to reduce the number of PCR/sequencing artifacts that arise and identify the ones that remain. Our streamlined workflow combines random cleavage of the DNA in the samples, end repair, and linker ligation in a single step. We provide guidance on primer and linker design that reduces some of the common artifacts. We also discuss how to identify and remove some of the common artifacts, including the products of PCR mispriming and PCR recombination, that have appeared in some published studies. Our improved bioinformatics pipeline rapidly parses the sequencing data and identifies bona fide integration sites in clonally expanded cells, producing an Excel-formatted report that can be used for additional data processing.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide a detailed protocol that reduces the prevalence of artifacts that arise in the analysis of retroviral integration site data generated from in vivo samples and a bioinformatics pipeline that is able to remove the artifacts that remain.},

	abstract = {In adults starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) during acute infection, 2\% of proviruses that persist on ART are genetically intact by sequence analysis. In contrast, a recent report in children treated early failed to detect sequence-intact proviruses. In another cohort of children treated early, we sought to detect and characterize proviral sequences after 6 to 9 years on suppressive ART. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from perinatally infected children from the Children with HIV Early antiRetroviral (CHER) study were analyzed. Nearly full-length proviral amplification and sequencing (NFL-PAS) were performed at one time point after 6 to 9 years on ART. Amplicons with large internal deletions were excluded ({\textless}9 kb). All amplicons of ≥9 kb were sequenced and analyzed through a bioinformatic pipeline to detect indels, frameshifts, or hypermutations that would render them defective. In eight children who started ART at a median age of 5.4 months (range, 2.0 to 11.1 months), 733 single NFL-PAS amplicons were generated. Of these, 534 (72.9\%) had large internal deletions, 174 (23.7\%) had hypermutations, 15 (1.4\%) had small internal deletions, 3 (1.0\%) had deletions in the packaging signal/major splice donor site, and 7 (1.0\%) were sequence intact. These 7 intact sequences were from three children who initiated ART after 2.3 months of age, one of whom had two identical intact sequences, suggestive of a cell clone harboring a replication-competent provirus. No intact proviruses were detected in four children who initiated ART before 2.3 months of age. Rare, intact proviruses can be detected in children who initiate ART after 2.3 months of age and are probably, as in adults, maintained by clonal expansion of cells infected before ART initiation.IMPORTANCE There are limited data about the proviral landscape in children exhibiting long-term suppression after early treatment, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa where HIV-1 subtype C predominates. Investigating the sequence-intact reservoir could provide insight on the mechanisms by which intact proviruses persist and inform ongoing cure efforts. Through nearly full-length proviral amplification and sequencing (NFL-PAS), we generated 733 NFL-PAS amplicons from eight children. We showed that rare, genetically intact proviruses could be detected in children who initiated ART after 2.3 months of age. The frequency of intact proviruses was lower (P {\textless} 0.05) than that reported for HIV subtype B-infected adults treated during early HIV infection. We show that cells harboring genetically intact HIV proviruses are rare in children exhibiting long-term suppression after early treatment and may require the processing of a large number of cells to assess reservoir size. This points to the need for efficient methods to accurately quantify latent reservoirs, particularly in pediatric studies where sample availability is limited.},

	abstract = {Significance
            To develop a cure for HIV-1, it is necessary to understand how infected cells persist despite treatment. Integrated HIV DNA (proviruses) can be distinguished by their sites of integration into the host genome and by their proviral sequence. We applied multiple-displacement amplification (MDA) to single proviruses isolated from blood and lymph nodes to determine their integration sites and full-length sequences. We found that identical subgenomic HIV-1 sequences can result from either clonal expansion or from genetic bottlenecks that occurred with transmission or with the emergence of drug resistance mutations. Furthermore, we show this MDA approach can be used to infer intact ancestral HIV-1 sequences from the archives of defective ones, providing an approach for investigations of HIV-1 evolution in vivo.
          , 
            Understanding HIV-1 persistence despite antiretroviral therapy (ART) is of paramount importance. Both single-genome sequencing (SGS) and integration site analysis (ISA) provide useful information regarding the structure of persistent HIV DNA populations; however, until recently, there was no way to link integration sites to their cognate proviral sequences. Here, we used multiple-displacement amplification (MDA) of cellular DNA diluted to a proviral endpoint to obtain full-length proviral sequences and their corresponding sites of integration. We applied this method to lymph node and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 5 ART-treated donors to determine whether groups of identical subgenomic sequences in the 2 compartments are the result of clonal expansion of infected cells or a viral genetic bottleneck. We found that identical proviral sequences can result from both cellular expansion and viral genetic bottlenecks occurring prior to ART initiation and following ART failure. We identified an expanded T cell clone carrying an intact provirus that matched a variant previously detected by viral outgrowth assays and expanded clones with wild-type and drug-resistant defective proviruses. We also found 2 clones from 1 donor that carried identical proviruses except for nonoverlapping deletions, from which we could infer the sequence of the intact parental virus. Thus, MDA-SGS can be used for “viral reconstruction” to better understand intrapatient HIV-1 evolution and to determine the clonality and structure of proviruses within expanded clones, including those with drug-resistant mutations. Importantly, we demonstrate that identical sequences observed by standard SGS are not always sufficient to establish proviral clonality.},

          , 
            HIV persistence during combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is the principal obstacle to cure. Mechanisms responsible for persistence remain uncertain; infections may be maintained by persistence and clonal expansion of infected cells or by ongoing replication in anatomic locations with poor antiretroviral penetration. These mechanisms require different strategies for eradication, and determining their contributions to HIV persistence is essential. We used phylogenetic approaches to investigate, at the DNA level, HIV populations in blood, lymphoid, and other infected tissues obtained at colonoscopy or autopsy in individuals who were on cART for 8 to 16 years. We found no evidence of ongoing replication or compartmentalization of HIV; we did detect clonal expansion of infected cells that were present before cART. Long-term persistence, and not ongoing replication, is primarily responsible for maintaining HIV. HIV-infected cells present when cART is initiated represent the only identifiable source of persistence and is the appropriate focus for eradication.},

This review describes common methods used to obtain and analyze intra-patient HIV sequence data, the accumulation of diversity prior to ART and how it is affected by suppressive ART, the debate on viral replication and evolution in the presence of ART, HIV compartmentalization across various tissues, and mechanisms for the emergence of drug resistance. It also describes how CD4+ T cells that were likely infected with latent proviruses prior to initiating treatment can proliferate before and during ART, providing a renewable source of infected cells despite therapy. Some expanded cell clones carry intact and replication-competent proviruses with a small fraction of the clonal siblings being transcriptionally active and a source for residual viremia on ART. Such cells may also be the source for viral rebound after interrupting ART. The identical viral sequences observed for many years in both the plasma and infected cells of patients on long-term ART are likely due to the proliferation of infected cells both prior to and during treatment. Studies on HIV diversity may reveal targets that can be exploited in efforts to eradicate or control the infection without ART.},

We analyzed the same sequences and found that the dataset was very limited (median of 5 unique RNA or DNA sequences per sample) after accounting for polymerase chain reaction resampling and hypermutation and that the few remaining DNA sequences after 3 and 6 months on ART were not more diverse or divergent from those in pre-ART in any of the individuals studied.

	abstract = {It remains controversial whether current antiretroviral therapy (ART) fully suppresses the cycles of HIV replication and viral evolution in vivo. If replication persists in sanctuary sites such as the lymph nodes, a high priority should be placed on improving ART regimes to target these sites. To investigate the question of ongoing viral replication on current ART regimens, we analyzed HIV populations in longitudinal samples from 10 HIV-1-infected children who initiated ART when viral diversity was low. Eight children started ART at less than ten months of age and showed suppression of plasma viremia for seven to nine years. Two children had uncontrolled viremia for fifteen and thirty months, respectively, before viremia suppression, and served as positive controls for HIV replication and evolution. These latter 2 children showed clear evidence of virus evolution, whereas multiple methods of analysis bore no evidence of virus evolution in any of the 8 children with viremia suppression on ART. Phylogenetic trees simulated with the recently reported evolutionary rate of HIV-1 on ART of 6 × 10-4 substitutions/site/month bore no resemblance to the observed data. Taken together, these data refute the concept that ongoing HIV replication is common with ART and is the major barrier to curing HIV-1 infection.},

This article reviews methods for interrogating intrahost HIV-1 diversity, addresses the ongoing debate regarding HIV-1 compartmentalization and replication during ART, and summarizes recent findings on the effects of curative strategies on HIV-1 populations.
RECENT FINDINGS: HIV-1 replication in the blood is virtually halted upon the initiation of ART. However, proliferation of cells infected prior to ART provides a self-renewing reservoir for infection during ART. Current evidence supports that proliferation of infected cells is a mechanism for HIV-1 persistence in both the blood and the tissues. However, more studies are required to determine if tissue sanctuaries exist that may also allow viral replication during ART. Recent studies investigating potential curative interventions show little effect on the genetic landscape of HIV-1 infection and highlight the need to develop strategies targeting the proliferation of infected cells.
SUMMARY: Using phylogeny to characterize HIV-1 genetic diversity and evolution during ART has demonstrated a lack of viral replication, the proliferation of infected cells, and provides one metric to measure the effect of new interventions aimed at achieving a functional cure for HIV-1.},

	abstract = {Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is highly effective at inhibiting HIV-1 replication and preventing AIDS, it cannot eradicate the infection. Many studies have used viral genetic information from single-genome and deep sequencing of blood and tissue samples to investigate the mechanisms that sustain the HIV-1 reservoir. Sequence data are analysed by use of measurements of population diversity and divergence and by exploration of phylogenetic associations. The study of intrahost HIV-1 populations on ART requires specific considerations as their dynamics can be shaped by host factors such as cell death and proliferation. Hence, understanding both the biology of HIV-1 persistence and the phylogenetic methods that can be applied to this field is crucial. We conclude that the most suitable phylogenetic methods and evolutionary models for characterising HIV-1 populations on ART include using neighbour-joining trees to identify identical proviral sequences that might result from T-cell proliferation, and using maximum-likelihood analysis to investigate the possibility of ongoing viral replication on ART. Characterising the reservoir for HIV-1 on ART is a high priority for the design of curative interventions.},

            The characterisation of the HIV-1 reservoir, which consists of replication-competent integrated proviruses that persist on antiretroviral therapy (ART), is made difficult by the rarity of intact proviruses relative to those that are defective. While the only conclusive test for the replication-competence of HIV-1 proviruses is carried out in cell culture, genetic characterization of genomes by near full-length (NFL) PCR and sequencing can be used to determine whether particular proviruses have insertions, deletions, or substitutions that render them defective. Proviruses that are not excluded by having such defects can be classified as genetically intact and, possibly, replication competent. Identifying and quantifying proviruses that are potentially replication-competent is important for the development of strategies towards a functional cure. However, to date, there are no programs that can be incorporated into deep-sequencing pipelines for the automated characterization and annotation of HIV genomes. Existing programs that perform this work require manual intervention, cannot be widely installed, and do not have easily adjustable settings. Here, we present HIVIntact, a python-based software tool that characterises genomic defects in NFL HIV-1 sequences, allowing putative intact genomes to be identified in-silico. Unlike other applications that assess the genetic intactness of HIV genomes, this tool can be incorporated into existing sequence-analysis pipelines and applied to large next-generation sequencing datasets.},

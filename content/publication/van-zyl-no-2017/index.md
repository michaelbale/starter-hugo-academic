abstract: It remains controversial whether current antiretroviral therapy (ART) fully
  suppresses the cycles of HIV replication and viral evolution in vivo. If replication
  persists in sanctuary sites such as the lymph nodes, a high priority should be placed
  on improving ART regimes to target these sites. To investigate the question of ongoing
  viral replication on current ART regimens, we analyzed HIV populations in longitudinal
  samples from 10 HIV-1-infected children who initiated ART when viral diversity was
  low. Eight children started ART at less than ten months of age and showed suppression
  of plasma viremia for seven to nine years. Two children had uncontrolled viremia
  for fifteen and thirty months, respectively, before viremia suppression, and served
  as positive controls for HIV replication and evolution. These latter 2 children
  showed clear evidence of virus evolution, whereas multiple methods of analysis bore
  no evidence of virus evolution in any of the 8 children with viremia suppression
  on ART. Phylogenetic trees simulated with the recently reported evolutionary rate
  of HIV-1 on ART of 6 Ã— 10-4 substitutions/site/month bore no resemblance to the
  observed data. Taken together, these data refute the concept that ongoing HIV replication
  is common with ART and is the major barrier to curing HIV-1 infection.

abstract: Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is highly effective at inhibiting
  HIV-1 replication and preventing AIDS, it cannot eradicate the infection. Many studies
  have used viral genetic information from single-genome and deep sequencing of blood
  and tissue samples to investigate the mechanisms that sustain the HIV-1 reservoir.
  Sequence data are analysed by use of measurements of population diversity and divergence
  and by exploration of phylogenetic associations. The study of intrahost HIV-1 populations
  on ART requires specific considerations as their dynamics can be shaped by host
  factors such as cell death and proliferation. Hence, understanding both the biology
  of HIV-1 persistence and the phylogenetic methods that can be applied to this field
  is crucial. We conclude that the most suitable phylogenetic methods and evolutionary
  models for characterising HIV-1 populations on ART include using neighbour-joining
  trees to identify identical proviral sequences that might result from T-cell proliferation,
  and using maximum-likelihood analysis to investigate the possibility of ongoing
  viral replication on ART. Characterising the reservoir for HIV-1 on ART is a high
  priority for the design of curative interventions.

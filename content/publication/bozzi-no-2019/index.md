abstract: Long-term persistence, not ongoing virus replication, is primarily responsible
  for maintaining HIV during antiretroviral therapy. ,  HIV persistence during combination
  antiretroviral therapy (cART) is the principal obstacle to cure. Mechanisms responsible
  for persistence remain uncertain; infections may be maintained by persistence and
  clonal expansion of infected cells or by ongoing replication in anatomic locations
  with poor antiretroviral penetration. These mechanisms require different strategies
  for eradication, and determining their contributions to HIV persistence is essential.
  We used phylogenetic approaches to investigate, at the DNA level, HIV populations
  in blood, lymphoid, and other infected tissues obtained at colonoscopy or autopsy
  in individuals who were on cART for 8 to 16 years. We found no evidence of ongoing
  replication or compartmentalization of HIV; we did detect clonal expansion of infected
  cells that were present before cART. Long-term persistence, and not ongoing replication,
  is primarily responsible for maintaining HIV. HIV-infected cells present when cART
  is initiated represent the only identifiable source of persistence and is the appropriate
  focus for eradication.

abstract: HIV persists during antiretroviral therapy (ART) as integrated proviruses
  in cells descended from a small fraction of the CD4+ T cells infected prior to the
  initiation of ART. To better understand what controls HIV persistence and the distribution
  of integration sites (IS), we compared about 15,000 and 54,000 IS from individuals
  pre-ART and on ART, respectively, with approximately 395,000 IS from PBMC infected
  in vitro. The distribution of IS in vivo is quite similar to the distribution in
  PBMC, but modified by selection against proviruses in expressed genes, by selection
  for proviruses integrated into one of 7 specific genes, and by clonal expansion.
  Clones in which a provirus integrated in an oncogene contributed to cell survival
  comprised only a small fraction of the clones persisting in on ART. Mechanisms that
  do not involve the provirus, or its location in the host genome, are more important
  in determining which clones expand and persist.

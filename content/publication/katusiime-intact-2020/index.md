abstract: In adults starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) during acute infection,
  2% of proviruses that persist on ART are genetically intact by sequence analysis.
  In contrast, a recent report in children treated early failed to detect sequence-intact
  proviruses. In another cohort of children treated early, we sought to detect and
  characterize proviral sequences after 6 to 9 years on suppressive ART. Peripheral
  blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from perinatally infected children from the Children
  with HIV Early antiRetroviral (CHER) study were analyzed. Nearly full-length proviral
  amplification and sequencing (NFL-PAS) were performed at one time point after 6
  to 9 years on ART. Amplicons with large internal deletions were excluded (textless9
  kb). All amplicons of ≥9 kb were sequenced and analyzed through a bioinformatic
  pipeline to detect indels, frameshifts, or hypermutations that would render them
  defective. In eight children who started ART at a median age of 5.4 months (range,
  2.0 to 11.1 months), 733 single NFL-PAS amplicons were generated. Of these, 534
  (72.9%) had large internal deletions, 174 (23.7%) had hypermutations, 15 (1.4%)
  had small internal deletions, 3 (1.0%) had deletions in the packaging signal/major
  splice donor site, and 7 (1.0%) were sequence intact. These 7 intact sequences were
  from three children who initiated ART after 2.3 months of age, one of whom had two
  identical intact sequences, suggestive of a cell clone harboring a replication-competent
  provirus. No intact proviruses were detected in four children who initiated ART
  before 2.3 months of age. Rare, intact proviruses can be detected in children who
  initiate ART after 2.3 months of age and are probably, as in adults, maintained
  by clonal expansion of cells infected before ART initiation.IMPORTANCE There are
  limited data about the proviral landscape in children exhibiting long-term suppression
  after early treatment, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa where HIV-1 subtype C
  predominates. Investigating the sequence-intact reservoir could provide insight
  on the mechanisms by which intact proviruses persist and inform ongoing cure efforts.
  Through nearly full-length proviral amplification and sequencing (NFL-PAS), we generated
  733 NFL-PAS amplicons from eight children. We showed that rare, genetically intact
  proviruses could be detected in children who initiated ART after 2.3 months of age.
  The frequency of intact proviruses was lower (P textless 0.05) than that reported
  for HIV subtype B-infected adults treated during early HIV infection. We show that
  cells harboring genetically intact HIV proviruses are rare in children exhibiting
  long-term suppression after early treatment and may require the processing of a
  large number of cells to assess reservoir size. This points to the need for efficient
  methods to accurately quantify latent reservoirs, particularly in pediatric studies
  where sample availability is limited.

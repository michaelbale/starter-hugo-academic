abstract: The latent HIV-1 reservoir is comprised of stably integrated and intact
  proviruses with limited to no viral transcription. It has been proposed that latent
  infection may be maintained by methylation of pro-viral DNA. Here, for the first
  time, we investigate the cytosine methylation of a replication competent provirus
  (AMBI-1) found in a T cell clone in a donor on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methylation
  profiles of the AMBI-1 provirus were compared to other proviruses in the same donor
  and in samples from three other individuals on ART, including proviruses isolated
  from lymph node mononuclear cells (LNMCs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells
  (PBMCs). We also evaluated the apparent methylation of cytosines outside of CpG
  (i.e., CpH) motifs. We found no evidence for methylation in AMBI-1 or any other
  provirus tested within the 5′ LTR promoter. In contrast, CpG methylation was observed
  in the env-tat-rev overlapping reading frame. In addition, we found evidence for
  differential provirus methylation in cells isolated from LNMCs vs. PBMCs in some
  individuals, possibly from the expansion of infected cell clones. Finally, we determined
  that apparent low-level methylation of CpH cytosines is consistent with occasional
  bisulfite reaction failures. In conclusion, our data do not support the proposition
  that latent HIV infection is associated with methylation of the HIV 5′ LTR promoter.

abstract: Lorenzo-Redondo et al. recently analyzed HIV RNA sequences in plasma virus
  and proviral DNA sequences in lymph nodes (LN) and peripheral blood mononuclear
  cells (PBMC) from samples collected over a 6-month period from 3 individuals following
  initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and concluded that ongoing HIV replication
  occurred in LN despite ART and that this replication maintained the HIV reservoir.
  We analyzed the same sequences and found that the dataset was very limited (median
  of 5 unique RNA or DNA sequences per sample) after accounting for polymerase chain
  reaction resampling and hypermutation and that the few remaining DNA sequences after
  3 and 6 months on ART were not more diverse or divergent from those in pre-ART in
  any of the individuals studied. These findings, and others, lead us to conclude
  that the claims of ongoing replication on ART made by Lorenzo-Redondo et al. are
  not justified from the dataset analyzed in their publication.

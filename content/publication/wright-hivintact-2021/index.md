abstract: Abstract The characterisation of the HIV-1 reservoir, which consists of
  replication-competent integrated proviruses that persist on antiretroviral therapy
  (ART), is made difficult by the rarity of intact proviruses relative to those that
  are defective. While the only conclusive test for the replication-competence of
  HIV-1 proviruses is carried out in cell culture, genetic characterization of genomes
  by near full-length (NFL) PCR and sequencing can be used to determine whether particular
  proviruses have insertions, deletions, or substitutions that render them defective.
  Proviruses that are not excluded by having such defects can be classified as genetically
  intact and, possibly, replication competent. Identifying and quantifying proviruses
  that are potentially replication-competent is important for the development of strategies
  towards a functional cure. However, to date, there are no programs that can be incorporated
  into deep-sequencing pipelines for the automated characterization and annotation
  of HIV genomes. Existing programs that perform this work require manual intervention,
  cannot be widely installed, and do not have easily adjustable settings. Here, we
  present HIVIntact, a python-based software tool that characterises genomic defects
  in NFL HIV-1 sequences, allowing putative intact genomes to be identified in-silico.
  Unlike other applications that assess the genetic intactness of HIV genomes, this
  tool can be incorporated into existing sequence-analysis pipelines and applied to
  large next-generation sequencing datasets.

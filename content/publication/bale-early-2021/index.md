abstract: HIV-1 integrates its genome into the DNA of host cells. Consequently, HIV-1
  genomes are copied with the host cell DNA during cellular division. ,  ABSTRACT  Little
  is known about the emergence and persistence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected
  T-cell clones in perinatally infected children. We analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear
  cells (PBMCs) for clonal expansion in 11 children who initiated antiretroviral therapy
  (ART) between 1.8 and 17.4 months of age and with viremia suppressed for 6 to 9 years.
  We obtained 8,662 HIV type 1 (HIV-1) integration sites from pre-ART samples and
  1,861 sites from on-ART samples. Expanded clones of infected cells were detected
  pre-ART in 10/11 children. In 8 children, infected cell clones detected pre-ART
  persisted for 6 to 9 years on ART. A comparison of integration sites in the samples
  obtained on ART with healthy donor PBMCs infected ex vivo showed selection for cells
  with proviruses integrated in BACH2 and STAT5B . Our analyses indicate that, despite
  marked differences in T-cell composition and dynamics between children and adults,
  HIV-infected cell clones are established early in children, persist for up to 9 years
  on ART, and can be driven by proviral integration in proto-oncogenes.   IMPORTANCE
  HIV-1 integrates its genome into the DNA of host cells. Consequently, HIV-1 genomes
  are copied with the host cell DNA during cellular division. Pediatric immune systems
  differ significantly from adults, consisting primarily of naive T cells, which have
  low expression of the HIV-1 coreceptor CCR5. This difference may result in variances
  in the number or size of infected cell clones that persist in children on ART. Here,
  we provide the most extensive analysis of the integration landscape of HIV-1 in
  children. We found that, despite the largely naive cell populations in neonatal
  immune systems, patterns of HIV-1 integration and the size of infected cell clones
  are as large and widespread as those in adults. Furthermore, selection for integration
  events in proto-oncogenes were observed in children despite early ART. If such cell
  clones persist for the life span of these individuals, there may be long-term consequences
  that have yet to be realized.

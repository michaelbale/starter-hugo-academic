abstract: 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Studies of HIV-1 genetic diversity can provide clues
  on the effect of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on viral replication, the mechanisms
  for viral persistence, and the efficacy of new interventions. This article reviews
  methods for interrogating intrahost HIV-1 diversity, addresses the ongoing debate
  regarding HIV-1 compartmentalization and replication during ART, and summarizes
  recent findings on the effects of curative strategies on HIV-1 populations. RECENT
  FINDINGS: HIV-1 replication in the blood is virtually halted upon the initiation
  of ART. However, proliferation of cells infected prior to ART provides a self-renewing
  reservoir for infection during ART. Current evidence supports that proliferation
  of infected cells is a mechanism for HIV-1 persistence in both the blood and the
  tissues. However, more studies are required to determine if tissue sanctuaries exist
  that may also allow viral replication during ART. Recent studies investigating potential
  curative interventions show little effect on the genetic landscape of HIV-1 infection
  and highlight the need to develop strategies targeting the proliferation of infected
  cells. SUMMARY: Using phylogeny to characterize HIV-1 genetic diversity and evolution
  during ART has demonstrated a lack of viral replication, the proliferation of infected
  cells, and provides one metric to measure the effect of new interventions aimed
  at achieving a functional cure for HIV-1.'

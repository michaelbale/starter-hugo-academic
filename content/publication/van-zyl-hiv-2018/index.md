abstract: Characterizing HIV genetic diversity and evolution during antiretroviral
  therapy (ART) provides insights into the mechanisms that maintain the viral reservoir
  during ART. This review describes common methods used to obtain and analyze intra-patient
  HIV sequence data, the accumulation of diversity prior to ART and how it is affected
  by suppressive ART, the debate on viral replication and evolution in the presence
  of ART, HIV compartmentalization across various tissues, and mechanisms for the
  emergence of drug resistance. It also describes how CD4+ T cells that were likely
  infected with latent proviruses prior to initiating treatment can proliferate before
  and during ART, providing a renewable source of infected cells despite therapy.
  Some expanded cell clones carry intact and replication-competent proviruses with
  a small fraction of the clonal siblings being transcriptionally active and a source
  for residual viremia on ART. Such cells may also be the source for viral rebound
  after interrupting ART. The identical viral sequences observed for many years in
  both the plasma and infected cells of patients on long-term ART are likely due to
  the proliferation of infected cells both prior to and during treatment. Studies
  on HIV diversity may reveal targets that can be exploited in efforts to eradicate
  or control the infection without ART.

Michael Bale, MSc, is a PhD student in the Immunology and Microbial Pathogenesis program (IMP) at Weill Cornell Medical College. His thesis work in the lab of Steven Josefowicz, PhD, involves defining the role of stimulation-induced phosphorylation of histone H3, and in particular H3.3, at Serines 28 (H3S28ph), and 31 (H3.3S31ph) in T cell function, differentiation, and exhaustion. Additionally, Michael's work involves the integration of multi-omic datasets and multi-target ChIP-seq/CUT&RUN/CUT&Tag datasets in the analysis of stimulation-induced or cell-type identity-defining epigenetic changes as part of an SBIR-grant with industry partner EpiCypher and the Immunological Genome (ImmGen) Consortium.
